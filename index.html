        <h3>Define: Shai Lachmanovich</h3>

        <p>
            Hi, my name is Shai Lachmanovich, and this page is all about my skills, interests and hobbies.
        </p>

        <h4>What I do</h4>

        <p>
            I'm currently working for <a href="http://www.wix.com" target="_blank">Wix</a> in the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/startup-wix-has-one-of-the-most-spectacular-offices-in-isreal-2013-4?op=1" target="_blank">Tel-Aviv office</a> as a senior front end developer.
            My team is responsible for creating new web components for our users' benefit.
            We mostly code in native <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, and work in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">Agile Environment</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm also in the process of obtaining a Bachelor degree in economics in <a href="http://english.tau.ac.il/" target="_blank">Tel-Aviv University</a>, and just finished my 4th semester (out of 7).
        </p>

        <h4>What I used to do</h4>

        <p>
            For around 2½ years before I joined Wix, I was involved in number of initiatives, both as an entrepreneur and as a developer.
        </p>

        <h5>DataQuarry</h5>

        <p>
            I started DataQuarry with a friend from a previous job. The company gave consultancy services in the fields of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence" target="_blank">BI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining" target="_blank">Data Mining</a>.
            The 2 years in DataQuarry gave me lots of experience in how to run a business, how to negotiate and how to market (and also how not to do any of the above).

        <h5>Tricode Applications</h5>

        <p>
            Also a company founded with friends, Tricode was a contractor company for mobile apps. We built premium apps for our clients on both Android and iOS platforms.
            One of our greatest successes was Pnyphone, an app we actually did for ourselves, which reached great distribution with ~100,000 downloads.

        <h5>Gimme</h5>

        <p>
            A startup I started with friends, Gimme was a smart agent for group coupons.
            This was my first full stack project, where I was responsible of building both the front end and the back end API.

        <h4>What I'm planning to do</h4>

        <p>
            I code in a variety of languages, in different levels of efficiency:
        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>PHP</li>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Interests</h4>
        <h4>Hobbies</h4>


        <h4>Some background</h4>

        <p>
            I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987" target="_blank">1987</a> in <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa" target="_blank">Haifa, Israel</a>.
            My mom, a high school English teacher, was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich"
                                                                  target="_blank">Zurich, Switzerland</a>, so I have
            both Israeli and Swiss citizenship.
            My dad,
            I have 3 sisters, one my senior and two (twins) my junior;

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

        <p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

        <h3>
            <a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span
                    class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

        <p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through
            them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can
            revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained
            markdown format.</p>

        <h3>
            <a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span
                    class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

        <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your
            repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support
            Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it
            easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers
            intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

        <h3>
            <a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span
                    class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

        <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate
            a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub
            Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>),
            PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner
            (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
